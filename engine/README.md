**The self-improving AI agent.** It's an agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure that costs nearly nothing when idle. Not tied to your laptop — talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM.

Use any model you want — [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (200+ models), [Xiaomi MiMo](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com), [z.ai/GLM](https://z.ai), [Kimi/Moonshot](https://platform.moonshot.ai), [MiniMax](https://www.minimax.io), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), OpenAI, Anthropic, or your own endpoint. Switch with `bitidea model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sabrinaberger083-sys/bitidea-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Works on Linux, macOS, WSL2, and Android via Termux.

<details>
<summary>Manual install (developer mode)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabrinaberger083-sys/bitidea-agent
cd bitidea-agent
python3.11 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
bitidea --version
```
</details>

> **Android / Termux:** The tested manual path is documented in the [Termux guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/termux). On Termux, Bitidea installs a curated `.[termux]` extra because the full `.[all]` extra currently pulls Android-incompatible voice dependencies.
>
> **Windows:** Native Windows is not supported. Please install [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and run the command above.

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
bitidea              # start chatting!
```

---

## Getting Started

```bash
bitidea              # Interactive CLI — start a conversation
bitidea model        # Choose your LLM provider and model
bitidea tools        # Configure which tools are enabled
bitidea config set   # Set individual config values
bitidea gateway      # Start the messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
bitidea setup        # Run the full setup wizard (configures everything at once)
bitidea claw migrate # Migrate from OpenClaw (if coming from OpenClaw)
bitidea update       # Update to the latest version
bitidea doctor       # Diagnose any issues
```

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Bitidea has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `bitidea`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action | CLI | Messaging platforms |
|---------|-----|---------------------|
| Start chatting | `bitidea` | Run `bitidea gateway setup` + `bitidea gateway start`, then send the bot a message |
| Start fresh conversation | `/new` or `/reset` | `/new` or `/reset` |
| Change model | `/model [provider:model]` | `/model [provider:model]` |
| Set a personality | `/personality [name]` | `/personality [name]` |
| Retry or undo the last turn | `/retry`, `/undo` | `/retry`, `/undo` |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]` |
| Browse skills | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>` | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>` |
| Interrupt current work | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message | `/stop` or send a new message |
| Platform-specific status | `/platforms` | `/status`, `/sethome` |

For the full command lists, see the [CLI guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli) and the [Messaging Gateway guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging).

## Migrating from OpenClaw

If you're coming from OpenClaw, Bitidea can automatically import your settings, memories, skills, and API keys.

**During first-time setup:** The setup wizard (`bitidea setup`) automatically detects `~/.openclaw` and offers to migrate before configuration begins.

**Anytime after install:**

```bash
bitidea claw migrate              # Interactive migration (full preset)
bitidea claw migrate --dry-run    # Preview what would be migrated
bitidea claw migrate --preset user-data   # Migrate without secrets
bitidea claw migrate --overwrite  # Overwrite existing conflicts
```

What gets imported:
- **SOUL.md** — persona file
- **Memories** — MEMORY.md and USER.md entries
- **Skills** — user-created skills → `~/.bitidea/skills/openclaw-imports/`
- **Command allowlist** — approval patterns
- **Messaging settings** — platform configs, allowed users, working directory
- **API keys** — allowlisted secrets (Telegram, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs)
- **TTS assets** — workspace audio files
- **Workspace instructions** — AGENTS.md (with `--workspace-target`)

See `bitidea claw migrate --help` for all options, or use the `openclaw-migration` skill for an interactive agent-guided migration with dry-run previews.
